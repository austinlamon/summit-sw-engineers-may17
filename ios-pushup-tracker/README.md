# About

Sample iOS app to track a user's pushups via touching the user's nose on a button on the screen. The app tracks the pushups, and verbally + visually tracks your progress in real-time. Upon hitting the stop button, the results are recorded and saved to Parse.

# Instructions

* Project built with Xcode 7, iOS 9, and Swift 2.0
* Make sure to open the workspace file (pushups.xcworkspace) as opposed to the project file (pushups.xcodeproj) since Cocoapods are used for this project
* You'll want to replace the Parse keys in the AppDelegate with your own
