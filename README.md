# Summit for SW Engineers - iOS
### Capital One Software Engineering Summit (January 2017) - iOS Tech Talk Code

Steps to get started (caveat: you must have a Mac for iOS development):
- In your terminal, navigate to a directory of your choosing, then run the following: 
  - `$ git clone https://github.com/austinlamon/summit-sw-engineers-jan17.git`
  - `$ cd summit-sw-engineers-jan17/ios-pushup-tracker/`
- Download [Xcode 8.2.1](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/download/)
- Open the `pushups.xcworkspace`, simply typing `$ open pushups.xcworkspace` will handle this once you've downloaded Xcode.
- Run the project in the simulator -- the keyboard shortcut `cmd + r` will do this for you.

For more information on the app, read the README, [here](https://github.com/austinlamon/summit-sw-engineers-jan17/tree/master/ios-pushup-tracker).
